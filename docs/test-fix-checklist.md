# Test Fix Self-Assessment Checklist

## For Each Test Case Fixed, Verify:

### Understanding & Analysis
- [ ] I can explain what this test is validating in business terms
- [ ] I identified the exact line/method where the test was failing
- [ ] I understand why the original implementation was incorrect
- [ ] I can trace the flow from test → controller → service → repository

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] My fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom
- [ ] I haven't broken any existing functionality
- [ ] The test now passes consistently (run it 3+ times)
- [ ] I haven't introduced any new test failures

### Code Quality
- [ ] My fix follows the existing code patterns and conventions
- [ ] I added appropriate error handling if needed
- [ ] My code is readable and well-commented
- [ ] I removed any debugging code or console logs

### Business Logic Validation
- [ ] The fix aligns with the business requirements described in the documentation
- [ ] The validation rules make sense from a trading system perspective
- [ ] I understand how this component fits into the larger system

### Documentation
- [ ] I documented my fix in the test-fixes-template.md file
- [ ] My git commit message follows the required format
- [ ] I can explain my solution to another developer

## Red Flags to Avoid
- ❌ Commenting out assertions to make tests pass
- ❌ Changing test expectations without understanding why
- ❌ Adding try-catch blocks that hide real errors
- ❌ Hardcoding values instead of fixing logic
- ❌ Skipping tests with @Ignore annotation
